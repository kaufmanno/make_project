The project is developed in a virtual environment using pipenv. It is therefore necessary to install pyenv and pipenv before starting the installation of the program.  

Pyenv will setup the virtual environment with the correct version of Python. Pipenv will add the required python dependencies automatically during installation.  

Refer to this [link](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) to install Pyenv and this [link](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/) to install Pipenv, the prerequisites.
